# Strategies to Boost Wikipedia Editing Activities

We aim to explore the key factors contributing to the success of Wikipedia. More specifically, we want to determine whether Wikipedia's growth is better supported by attracting new editors or by motivating current editors to increase their contributions.

We analyzed data on the number of editors and editing activities with various metrics, including edit counts, new page creations, net and absolute byte changes, and page edits, distinguishing between logged-in and anonymous editors who have edited at least once in a given month. We also considered data across multiple languagesâ€”Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.
